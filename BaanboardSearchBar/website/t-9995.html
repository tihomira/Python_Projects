Notes<br />
A common Windows 2000 problem is that when Baan sessions are launched from within Worktop, they appear in back of the Worktop application. This problem is not restricted to Worktop but many applications will show this behavior. The reason is that Windows 2000 by default does not allow applications to &quot;steal the focus&quot;. To solve this, download the TweakUI application from the Microsoft site. Extract the executable. After extraction, go to that folder and find the &quot;tweakui.inf&quot; file. Right click on this file and select the &quot;Install&quot; option from the context menu. After installation, double click the &quot;Tweak UI&quot; icon located in the Control Panel and go to the tab called &quot;General&quot;. There is a checkbox with the label &quot;Prevent applications from stealing focus&quot;. Uncheck this box.<br />
As an alternative, you can edit the systems registry manually: Open regedit (win2k\xp) or regedt32 (win98), locate the &quot;ForegroundLockTimeout&quot; key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop and set its value to 0. <br />
Worktop help will only work when Internet Explorer 4.1 SP2 is installed, but an automatic Internet Explorer update is provided whenever at least Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed. <br />
...<br />
Worktop 2.2.17 and later versions support multibyte languages. However, this only applies to the Worktop application itself. The Baan Data Navigator is not multibyte enabled and therefore the BDN integration of Worktop cannot be used on operating systems running multibyte languages. <br />
This version of Worktop is a full version. It contains all available translations and documentation. Documentation can be found in the /documents directory of the installation media. During installation a list of all available languages is displayed from which the languages can be selected that should be installed. Included languages are; Chinese (Simplified), Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazilian), Portuguese (European), Spanish and Swedish. <br />
